    <p>We are given the equation \(0.9c + 1.89r = 17.01\) and need to show that the following equations are equivalent to it:</p>
    <p>a. \(c = 18.9 - 2.1r\)</p>
    <p>b. \(r = -\frac{10}{21}c + 9\)</p>
    
    <p>Let's start with part (a):</p>
    <p>We begin with the original equation:</p>
    <p>\(0.9c + 1.89r = 17.01\)</p>
    <p>To isolate \(c\), we first subtract \(1.89r\) from both sides:</p>
    <p>\(0.9c = 17.01 - 1.89r\)</p>
    <p>Next, we divide both sides by \(0.9\):</p>
    <p>\(c = \frac{17.01 - 1.89r}{0.9}\)</p>
    <p>Performing the division:</p>
    <p>\(c = \frac{17.01}{0.9} - \frac{1.89r}{0.9}\)</p>
    <p>\(c = 18.9 - 2.1r\)</p>
    <p>Thus, we have shown that \(c = 18.9 - 2.1r\) is equivalent to the original equation.</p>
    
    <p>Now, let's move to part (b):</p>
    <p>We start again with the original equation:</p>
    <p>\(0.9c + 1.89r = 17.01\)</p>
    <p>To isolate \(r\), we first subtract \(0.9c\) from both sides:</p>
    <p>\(1.89r = 17.01 - 0.9c\)</p>
    <p>Next, we divide both sides by \(1.89\):</p>
    <p>\(r = \frac{17.01 - 0.9c}{1.89}\)</p>
    <p>Performing the division:</p>
    <p>\(r = \frac{17.01}{1.89} - \frac{0.9c}{1.89}\)</p>
    <p>\(r = 9 - \frac{0.9c}{1.89}\)</p>
    <p>Since \(\frac{0.9}{1.89} = \frac{10}{21}\), we have:</p>
    <p>\(r = 9 - \frac{10}{21}c\)</p>
    <p>Thus, we have shown that \(r = -\frac{10}{21}c + 9\) is equivalent to the original equation.</p>
    
    <p>In summary, we have demonstrated that both given equations are equivalent to the original equation \(0.9c + 1.89r = 17.01\).</p>
