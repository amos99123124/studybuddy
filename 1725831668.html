    <p>Let's solve the given long division problem: \( 2.760 \div 0.8 \).</p>
    <p>First, we convert the divisor \( 0.8 \) to a whole number by multiplying both the divisor and the dividend by 10. This gives us the equivalent problem \( 27.60 \div 8 \).</p>
    <p>Now, we perform the long division:</p>
    <p>
    \[
    \begin{array}{r|l}
      3.45 & 27.60 \\
         & -24 \\
         & \underline{36} \\
         & -32 \\
         & \underline{40} \\
         & -40 \\
         & 0
    \end{array}
    \]
    </p>
    <p>Here's a step-by-step breakdown:</p>
    <p>1. Divide 27 by 8, which goes 3 times. Write 3 above the division bar.</p>
    <p>2. Multiply 3 by 8, which is 24. Write 24 below 27 and subtract to get the remainder 3.</p>
    <p>3. Bring down the next digit, which is 6, making it 36.</p>
    <p>4. Divide 36 by 8, which goes 4 times. Write 4 above the division bar next to 3, making it 3.4.</p>
    <p>5. Multiply 4 by 8, which is 32. Write 32 below 36 and subtract to get the remainder 4.</p>
    <p>6. Bring down the next digit, which is 0, making it 40.</p>
    <p>7. Divide 40 by 8, which goes 5 times. Write 5 above the division bar next to 3.4, making it 3.45.</p>
    <p>8. Multiply 5 by 8, which is 40. Write 40 below 40 and subtract to get the remainder 0.</p>
    <p>Thus, the quotient is \( 3.45 \).</p>
