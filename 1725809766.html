    <p>To solve this problem, we need to determine the factor \( \lambda \) by which the surface area of the human brain would be larger than the mouse's brain if the human brain were not convoluted.</p>
    
    <p>Given that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The surface area of the human brain is 1000 times that of the mouse's brain.</li>
      <li>The human brain is convoluted, and the mouseâ€™s brain is not.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Let's denote:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>\( A_h \) as the actual surface area of the human brain (convoluted).</li>
      <li>\( A_m \) as the surface area of the mouse's brain.</li>
      <li>\( A_{h0} \) as the surface area of the human brain if it were not convoluted.</li>
      <li>\( \lambda \) as the factor by which the surface area increases due to convolutions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We know that:</p>
    <p>\( A_h = \lambda A_{h0} \)</p>
    
    <p>We are given that:</p>
    <p>\( A_h = 1000 A_m \)</p>
    
    <p>We need to find \( \lambda \) such that:</p>
    <p>\( A_{h0} \) is the surface area of the human brain if it were not convoluted.</p>
    
    <p>If the human brain were not convoluted, the surface area \( A_{h0} \) would be larger than the mouse's brain by a factor of \( \lambda \). So, we can write:</p>
    <p>\( A_{h0} = \lambda A_m \)</p>
    
    <p>Since \( A_h = 1000 A_m \) and \( A_h = \lambda A_{h0} \), we can substitute \( A_{h0} \) into the equation:</p>
    <p>\( 1000 A_m = \lambda (\lambda A_m) \)</p>
    <p>\( 1000 A_m = \lambda^2 A_m \)</p>
    
    <p>By dividing both sides by \( A_m \), we get:</p>
    <p>\( 1000 = \lambda^2 \)</p>
    
    <p>Taking the square root of both sides:</
