    <p>Let's break down the problem step-by-step.</p>
    <p>The problem states that the sculptor builds a small-scale model of a terrapin and discovers that it requires 2 kg of bronze to cast it. The final statue is supposed to be 5 times as large as the model in each dimension.</p>
    <p>We need to calculate how much bronze the sculptor will need to make the final statue.</p>
    <p>First, let's understand how the volume of the statue changes when the dimensions are scaled up.</p>
    <p>When each dimension of an object is scaled by a factor of \( k \), the volume scales by a factor of \( k^3 \).</p>
    <p>In this case, the dimensions are scaled by a factor of 5, so the volume will scale by:</p>
    <p>\( 5^3 \)</p>
    <p>\( 5^3 = 125 \)</p>
    <p>This means the final statue will be 125 times the volume of the small-scale model.</p>
    <p>Since the small-scale model requires 2 kg of bronze, the final statue will require:</p>
    <p>\( 2 \, \text{kg} \times 125 \)</p>
    <p>\( 2 \times 125 = 250 \, \text{kg} \)</p>
    <p>So, the sculptor will need 250 kg of bronze to cast the final statue.</p>
