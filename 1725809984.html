    <p>Let's break down the problem step-by-step.</p>
    <p>The problem states that the human brain has 1000 times the surface area of a mouse's brain. However, the human brain is convoluted (meaning it has folds), while the mouse's brain is not. We are asked to estimate by what factor, \( \lambda \), the surface area of the human brain would be larger than the mouse's if the human brain were not convoluted.</p>
    
    <p>To begin with, let's denote the surface area of the mouse's brain as \( A_m \) and the surface area of the human brain as \( A_h \).</p>
    
    <p>We are given that:</p>
    <p>\( A_h = 1000 \cdot A_m \)</p>
    
    <p>Now, because the human brain is convoluted, its surface area is increased. If the human brain were not convoluted, its surface area would be smaller by a factor \( \lambda \). Hence, the surface area of the non-convoluted human brain, \( A_h' \), would be:</p>
    <p>\( A_h' = \frac{A_h}{\lambda} \)</p>
    
    <p>Given \( A_h = 1000 \cdot A_m \), we can substitute this into the equation for \( A_h' \):</p>
    <p>\( A_h' = \frac{1000 \cdot A_m}{\lambda} \)</p>
    
    <p>Since we want the surface area of the non-convoluted human brain to be equal to the surface area of the mouse's brain, we set \( A_h' \) equal to \( A_m \):</p>
    <p>\( A_m = \frac{1000 \cdot A_m}{\lambda} \)</p>
    
    <p>To solve for \( \lambda \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \lambda \):</p>
    <p>\( \lambda \cdot A_m = 1000 \cdot A_m \)</p>
    
    <p>Next, we divide both sides by \( A_m \) (assuming \( A_m \neq 0 \)):</p>
    <p>\( \lambda = 1000 \)</p>
    
    <p>So, the factor \( \lambda \) by which the surface area of the human brain would be larger than the mouse's if the human brain were not convoluted is \(
