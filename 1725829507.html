    <p>Let's solve the problem of dividing \(2.760\) by \(0.8\).</p>
    
    <p>First, we need to make the divisor (\(0.8\)) a whole number. To do this, we multiply both the divisor and the dividend by \(10\):</p>
    
    <p>\(0.8 \times 10 = 8\)</p>
    <p>\(2.760 \times 10 = 27.60\)</p>
    
    <p>Now, our division problem becomes:</p>
    <p>\(\frac{27.60}{8}\)</p>
    
    <p>Next, we perform the division \(27.60 \div 8\). Let's go through this step-by-step:</p>
    
    <p>1. **Divide 27 by 8:**
    <p>
    \[
    27 \div 8 = 3 \quad \text{(since 8 times 3 is 24, which is the closest multiple of 8 that is less than 27)}
    \]
    </p>
    <p>2. **Subtract to find the remainder:**
    <p>
    \[
    27 - 24 = 3
    \]
    </p>
    <p>3. **Bring down the next digit, which is 6:**
    <p>
    \[
    3.6
    \]
    </p>
    <p>4. **Divide 36 by 8:**
    <p>
    \[
    36 \div 8 = 4 \quad \text{(since 8 times 4 is 32, which is the closest multiple of 8 that is less than 36)}
    \]
    </p>
    <p>5. **Subtract to find the remainder:**
    <p>
    \[
    36 - 32 = 4
    \]
    </p>
    <p>6. **Bring down the next digit, which is 0:**
    <p>
    \[
    4.0
    \]
    </p>
    <p>7. **Divide 40 by 8:**
    <p>
    \[
    40 \div 8 = 5 \quad \text{(since 8 times 5 is 40)}
    \]
    </p>
    <p>So, the quotient of \(27.60 \div 8\) is \(3.45\).</p>
    
    <p>Therefore, \(2.760 \div 0.8\) is:
    <p>
    \[
    3.45
    \]
    </p>
    
    <p>And that's the final answer!</p>
