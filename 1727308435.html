    <p>Let's solve the problem step-by-step.</p>
    <p>The problem involves identifying the direction of forces acting on blocks \(A\) and \(B\) when a force is applied to block \(A\) but it does not move.</p>
    <p>We need to determine the direction of the normal (N) and frictional (f) forces between the objects indicated.</p>
    <p>Given notations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>R means points to the right</li>
      <li>L means points to the left</li>
      <li>U means points up</li>
      <li>D means points down</li>
      <li>0 indicates there is no such force at the instant specified</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Part (a):</p>
    <p>You start pushing on block \(A\) as shown, but it is too heavy and does not move. While you are pushing on block \(A\) but while it is not moving, specify the direction of the following normal (N) and frictional (f) forces between the objects indicated.</p>
    <p>Let's analyze the forces:</p>
    <p>1. Normal force between block \(B\) and block \(A\) (\(N_{BA}\)):</p>
    <p>Since block \(B\) is on top of block \(A\), the normal force \(N_{BA}\) acts upward to counteract the weight of block \(B\).</p>
    <p>\(N_{BA} = U\)</p>
    <p>2. Frictional force between block \(B\) and block \(A\) (\(f_{BA}\)):</p>
    <p>Since block \(A\) is being pushed to the right and block \(B\) does not move, the frictional force \(f_{BA}\) acts to the left to prevent block \(B\) from sliding off block \(A\).</p>
    <p>\(f_{BA} = L\)</p>
    <p>3. Normal force between block \(A\) and the table (\(N_{AT}\)):</p>
    <p>The normal force \(N_{AT}\) acts upward to counteract the combined weight of blocks \(A\) and \(B\).</p>
    <p>\(N_{AT} = U\)</p>
    <p>4. Frictional force between block \(A\) and the table (\(f_{AT}\)):</p>
    <p>Since block \(A\) is being pushed to the right and does not move, the frictional force \(f_{AT}\) acts to the left to prevent block \(A\) from sliding.</p>
    <p>\(f_{AT} = L\)</p>
    <p>Therefore, the directions of the forces are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>\(N_{BA} = U\)</li>
      <li>\(f_{BA} = L\)</li>
      <li>\(N_{AT} = U\)</li>
      <li>\(f_{AT} = L\)</li>
    </ul>
