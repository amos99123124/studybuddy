    <p>In this question, we are asked to identify the event that takes place during anaphase II of meiosis. To understand this, let's first review what meiosis is and the specific stages involved.</p>
    
    <p>Meiosis is a type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, leading to the production of gametes (sperm and eggs). It consists of two main rounds of division: Meiosis I and Meiosis II.</p>
    
    <p>During anaphase II, the following events occur:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sister chromatids, which are the identical copies of a chromosome, are pulled apart and move towards opposite poles of the cell.</li>
      <li>This separation is crucial because it ensures that each gamete will receive one copy of each chromosome.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now, let's analyze the options provided:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sister chromatids are separated:</strong> This is the correct answer, as it describes the primary event of anaphase II.</li>
      <li><strong>Sister chromatids line up in the center of the cell:</strong> This occurs in metaphase II, not anaphase II.</li>
      <li><strong>Homologous chromosomes are separated:</strong> This happens during anaphase I, not anaphase II.</li>
      <li><strong>Homologous chromosomes line up in the center of the cell:</strong> This also occurs in metaphase I, not anaphase II.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In summary, the event that takes place during anaphase II is the separation of sister chromatids. Therefore, the correct choice is:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Answer: Sister chromatids are separated.</strong></p>
