    <p>Let's solve the division problem shown in the image:</p>
    <p>\( \text{The problem is to divide 2.760 by 0.8.} \)</p>
    <p>First, we simplify the division by eliminating the decimal from the divisor. We can do this by multiplying both the divisor and the dividend by 10. Thus, \( 0.8 \times 10 = 8 \) and \( 2.760 \times 10 = 27.60 \).</p>
    <p>Now, we perform the division \( \frac{27.60}{8} \).</p>
    <p>\[
    \begin{array}{r|l}
      8 & \underline{27.60} \\
      -24 & 3.45 \\
      \hline
      36 & \underline{36.0} \\
      -32 & 4.00 \\
      \hline
      40 & \underline{40.0} \\
      -40 & 0.00 \\
      \hline
    \end{array}
    \]</p>
    <p>In the first step, we see how many times 8 can fit into 27. Since \( 8 \times 3 = 24 \), we write 3 above the line, subtract 24 from 27 to get 3, and bring down the next digit (6), making it 36.</p>
    <p>We then see how many times 8 fits into 36. \( 8 \times 4 = 32 \), so we write 4 next to the 3, subtract 32 from 36 to get 4, and bring down the next digit (0), making it 40.</p>
    <p>Finally, \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \), so we write 5 next to the 4, subtract 40 from 40 to get 0, and there are no more digits to bring down, so we are done.</p>
    <p>The quotient of the division is 3.45, which is the result of dividing 2.760 by 0.8.</p>
