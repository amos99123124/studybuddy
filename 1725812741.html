    <p>Let's determine if each set of ordered pairs on the graphs represents a function. A function is defined as a relation in which each input (x-value) has exactly one output (y-value). The most straightforward way to check this on a graph is by using the vertical line test.</p>
    
    <p>The vertical line test states that if a vertical line intersects a graph in more than one point, the graph does not represent a function. Let's apply this test to each graph:</p>

    <p><b>Graph 1:</b></p>
    <p>We draw vertical lines through each x-coordinate:</p>
    <p>If any vertical line intersects more than one point, the graph is not a function. By inspecting Graph 1, we see that:</p>
    <p>\[
    \begin{array}{ccc}
    & & \\
    \text{(x = -16)} & \text{intersects at } & \text{one point} \\
    \text{(x = -12)} & \text{intersects at } & \text{one point} \\
    \text{(x = -6)} & \text{intersects at } & \text{one point} \\
    \text{(x = 6)} & \text{intersects at } & \text{one point} \\
    \text{(x = 20)} & \text{intersects at } & \text{one point} \\
    \end{array}
    \]
    Thus, Graph 1 <b>represents a function</b> since each vertical line intersects at exactly one point.</p>

    <p><b>Graph 2:</b></p>
    <p>We draw vertical lines through each x-coordinate:</p>
    <p>If any vertical line intersects more than one point, the graph is not a function. By inspecting Graph 2, we see that:</p>
    <p>\[
    \begin{array}{ccc}
    & & \\
    \text{(x = 2)} & \text{intersects at } & \text{one point} \\
    \text{(x =
